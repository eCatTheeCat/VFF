###### Here it is, after 6+ years of working on modpacks I've finally created something worth releasing. That's neat.
##### Roughly 130 mods, that all work with vanilla servers. Aimed at improved visuals, excellent game performance, and increased quality of life.
# Vanilla Friendly Fabric
## For 1.18.1
---
#### Why not 1.18.2? 
>Well mostly because I'm lazy, I've been working on this version since 1.18.1 came out and so many mods haven't even updated to 1.18.2 so I see no point in updating just to end up with a worse experience.
#### Why are some mods slightly out of date, why is this on fabric loader 0.12.12 when 0.13.x is out? 
>So it was really hard to get everything working together so well like this, many things are in and out of date for compatibility reasons alone. I will experiment with updating some mods, but its a really boring process so I donno how many I'll bother with.
